## About
StatusResponse is a web service which provides end users insight into the current status of 
your infrastructure (such as uptime and reliability), and provides a platform to distribute 
reports on incidents (such as downtime or degraded performance).

## Installation
StatusResponse consists of two parts: a NodeJS API Backend, which is responsible for polling 
services on their status, and a PHP Frontend.
